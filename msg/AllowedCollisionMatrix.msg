# In addition to the collision matrix itself, we also have
# the default entry value for each entry name.

# If the allowed collision flag is queried for a pair of names (n1, n2)
# that is not found in the collision matrix itself, the value of
# the collision flag is considered to be that of the entry (n1 or n2)
# specified in the list below. If both n1 and n2 are found in the list
# of defaults, the result is computed with an AND operation
