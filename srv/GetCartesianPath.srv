# If jump_threshold is set > 0, it acts as a scaling factor that is used to
# filter out large relative joint-space jumps in the generated Cartesian path.
# To this end, the average joint-space distance between consecutive waypoints
# is computed. If any joint-space distance is larger than this average distance
# by a factor of jump_threshold_factor, this step is considered a jump
# and the returned path is truncated before the step.

# If prismatic_jump_threshold or revolute_jump_threshold are set > 0, then for
# all active prismatic or revolute joints, the joint-space difference between
# consecutive waypoints is compared to the respective absolute threshold.
# If any threshold is exceeded, this step is considered a jump and the returned path
# is truncated before the step.
